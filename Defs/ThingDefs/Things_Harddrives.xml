	<!-- Not entirely sure how I should define these yet. I based this file partly off of the
		 Items_BrainScanning.xml file from Questionable Ethics Enhanced although they use a
		 "<modExtensions>" tag that I excluded as well as the graphics tabs. There was also
		 a "<thingCategories>" tag as well as a "<thingClass>" tag that I assume is how
		 it interacts with the code.-->
		 
	<!-- Another quick note: for SOME reason there is an item that's being created from the ThingDef
		 "NL_HarddriveBase" that doesn't have a defName or label so the game just automatically
		 gives it a blank name and label and I have no clue why -->
